## Database Structure

The Hotel Management Database consists of the following tables:

1. **Guests**: Stores information about the hotel guests, such as their unique ID, name, contact details, and other relevant data.
2. **Rooms**: Contains details about the hotel rooms, including the room number, room type, occupancy capacity, and other relevant information.
3. **Reservations**: Tracks the reservations made by guests, including the reservation ID, guest ID, room number, check-in date, check-out date, and other reservation details.
4. **Billing**: Manages the billing information associated with each reservation, including the bill ID, reservation ID, total amount, payment status, and other relevant data.
5. **Employees**: Stores information about the hotel employees, including their employee ID, name, position, contact details, and other relevant data.

The relationships between these tables are established through primary and foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity and enforce referential integrity.

## Setup Instructions

- Retrieve information about guests, rooms, reservations, or employees.
- Create new guest records, room records, or reservation records.
- Update guest details, room information, or reservation details.
- Delete guest records, room records, or reservation records.
